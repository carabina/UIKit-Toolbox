# Alan Yan's Swift UIKit Helpers
A Swift Toolbox to simplify boilerplate code and the view setup process

### Description:

I designed this UIKit Swift Package to help simplify my setup process for programattic views with different custom clases that can enable typical UIViews to be built fast, such as ShadowViews.

This package makes setting up layouts and views programatically a lot simpler. Includes support for setting up constraints programatically with simple methods. Features additional constructors for many of the main UIView subclasses, such as UIButton and UIImageView, makes setting up repeating views easier.
